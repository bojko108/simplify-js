[Simplify.js](https://github.com/mourner/simplify-js) written in ES6.

### In addition `simplify()` accepts array of coordinates:

```js
const points = [
    [224.55, 250.15], 
    [226.91, 244.19], 
    [233.31, 241.45], 
    [234.98, 236.06], 
    [244.21, 232.76], 
    [262.59, 215.31]
];

simplify(points, tollerance, highestQuality);
```

Simplify.js is a high-performance JavaScript polyline simplification library by Vladimir Agafonkin, extracted from [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com).
